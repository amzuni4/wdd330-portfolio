    <h1>Modular Javascript</h1>
    <p>

       For the assigned readings here, we were required to read about Modular Javascript.
        The section was only a paragraph long. <br />
        From what I understand, Modules help developers separate functionality and organize the code. 

        <h1>Module:</h1> 
       <p> A self contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can
        then be used in other files and by other modules. </p>

        <h1> Why are Modules important? </h1> 

        <p>
            Modules help keep the code organized by seperating into reusable files, which in turn, improves code maintainability.<br />
            Keeping code modular also helps to make it moreloosely coupledand interchangeable,
            meaning you can easily swap one module for another without affecting other parts of a project.
